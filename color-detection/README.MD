Run the script run.sh to execute color detection on the player images which are stored in the sub directory images.

The python script will produce a CSV file with the RGB color values and the percentage of that specific color

```
team,red,green,blue,percentage
team_a_4.jpg,148,144,76,41
team_a_4.jpg,4,4,3,35
team_a_4.jpg,87,85,69,23
```

# ToDo

Classify players based on the colors percentage so we can group them in either team A or B
